# Health Management System

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to create a system that can log and retrieve food and exercise records for multiple clients. The system should be easy to use and efficient in storing and retrieving data.

## My Process

### Built With

- Python: The entire project is built with Python, utilizing its powerful libraries and features.

### What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to effectively use Python's file handling capabilities to store and retrieve data. I also learned how to create a user-friendly interface that allows easy logging and retrieval of data.

### Continued Development

In the future, this project could be expanded to include more features such as tracking additional health metrics, providing health recommendations based on logged data, and integrating with health apps or devices.

### Useful Resources

- Python Documentation: The official Python documentation was invaluable in understanding how to use various Python features and libraries.
